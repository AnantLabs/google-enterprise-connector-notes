#summary Install your Google Enterprise Connector for Lotus Notes

= Introduction =
The *Google Enterprise Connector For Lotus Notes* is installed entirely on your Domino infrastructure. 

You should install the connector to a domino server to which you have administrative access.


==Installation instructions==
You will need to complete the following tasks to install the connector.

===Install Dependent Java Libraries===
The Connector uses the Jakarta Commons HttpClient software to post content to the GSA so before any feeding can begin, these files must be copied to your Domino Server.


Download the Commons clients from the [http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/ Jakarta HTTP Client home page]. 

You will need the following jars:
* commons-codec-1.3.jar
* commons-httpclient-3.0.jar
* commons-logging.jar

Copy them to your Domino Server's external Java classes’ folder. One a Microsoft Windows platform, this folder is the “jvm\lib\ext” folder, which is located beneath the Domino program folder. For example: If you install Domino to “C:\Lotus\Domino”, you would copy your “jar” files to: “C:\Lotus\Domino\jvm\lib\ext”
